signal template: 5k
injected signal: 500
--> expected r = 0.1

all fixed: 0.289221  -0.0283957/+0.0285134
--> rather bad fit in CR, a bit better in SR, signal actually fitted well

float TF: 0.170073  -0.0307965/+0.0306986
--> bad fit in CR and SR; TF tries to improve that, actually making it worse and the signal gets obstructed a bit

float TF and TO: fit failed

float TF, TO and BC5/6: 0.191667  -0.0300366/+0.030302
--> okay fit, modelling upwars fluctuation around signal bit too much

freeze BC0-2: 0.176389  -0.0307806/+0.0306968
--> as above

freeze BC01: 0.162503  -1.1625/+0.0307944

As long as three BC are freezed, it seems stable.
Info by Adinda: --cminDefaultMinimizerStrategy 0 --> does not require covariance matrix being positive definite --> returns fine intervals
--> not necessarily a problem, only if wanting to extract template uncertainty from it

Freeze TO: 0.175826  -0.0306625/+0.030804
--> fit okay

Freeze TOnovoeff: 0.172464  -1.17246/+0.0307425
Freeze SlopeNovoeff: 0.173316  -1.17332/+0.0305853

When running various tests for freezing both TO parameters: works sometimes with both sides of the limit being computed correctly but not nearly always (perhaps about 50% of the tries)

Uncertainty of r not driven by value of r! --> the data actually drives the uncertainty as expected, the signal strength injected does not mess with that
